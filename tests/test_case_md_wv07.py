"""Wave 0 grep-contract tests for the WV-07 case.md edit (Phase 92-01).

These tests assert the BEHAVIORAL CONTRACT that Plan 92-02 must satisfy by
editing case.md and progress-format.md.  Before Plan 92-02 lands:

  - test_webview_launch_present  RED  (lucy webview serve not yet in case.md)
  - test_stop_hint_present       RED  (lucy webview stop not yet in pre-terminate region)
  - test_terminate_team_no_stop  GREEN  (regression guard — server must outlive run)
  - test_progress_format_dashboard_field  RED  (**Dashboard:** not yet in progress-format.md)

After Plan 92-02 lands all four tests are GREEN.

All file reads use repo-relative paths (.claude/commands/lucy-ng/...) so tests
work from any checkout without touching ~/.claude.

Run with::

    pytest tests/test_case_md_wv07.py -v
